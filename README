Sequence data
-------------

* seqs/mrna-isoform1.fa:   This file contains the sequence of an mRNA with 3
                           exons. It was chosen randomly from the set of all
                           mRNAs in the P. dominula Maker annotation r1.0 with 3
                           exons, whose middle exon has length divisible by 3
                           (so that its removal does not disrupt the coding
                           sequence).

* seqs/cds-isoform1.fa:    This file contains the coding sequence corresponding
                           to mRNA isoform 1.

* seqs/mrna-isoform2.fa:   This file contains the sequence of an imaginary mRNA
                           with 2 exons. It was craeted by removing the internal
                           exon from isoform 1. For some exercises this will be
                           treated as an alternative splice variant to isoform
                           1.

* seqs/cds-isoform2.fa:    This file contains the coding sequence corresponding
                           to mRNA isoform 2.

* seqs/mrnas.fa:           This file contains the sequences of both mRNAs
                           described above.

* seqs/ilocus.fa:          This file contains the genomic sequence of the
                           interval locus to which the annotated mRNA belongs.

* seqs/tsa.fa:             This file contains the TSAs that aligned to the
                           ilocus.



Code

* bin/select.c:            This is the program used to identify all mRNAs that
                           matched the criteria described above: 3 exons, the
                           internal exon with a length divisible by 3.

* bin/sim.sh:              This is the script used to simulate sequence reads
                           using wgsim. Its usage is as follows.

                                    bin/sim.sh <seqs> <outdir>
