Sequence data
-------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* seqs/mrna-isoform1.fa:   This file contains the sequence of an mRNA. This mRNA
                           was selected randomly from the set of all P. dominula
                           mRNAs meeting the following criteria.
                             - has 3 exons
                             - internal exon has length > 150bp
                             - combined length of the terminal exons is > 500

* seqs/mrna-isoform2.fa:   This file contains the sequence of an imaginary mRNA
                           with 2 exons. It was created by removing the internal
                           exon from isoform 1. For some exercises this will be
                           treated as an alternative splice variant to isoform
                           1.

* seqs/mrnas.fa:           This file contains the sequences of both mRNAs
                           described above.

* seqs/ilocus.fa:          This file contains the genomic sequence of the
                           interval locus to which the annotated mRNA belongs.


Code
----

* bin/select.c:            This is the program used to identify all mRNAs that
                           matched the criteria described above.

* bin/sim.sh:              This is the script used to simulate sequence reads
                           using wgsim. Its usage is as follows.

                                    bin/sim.sh <seqs> <outdir>


Simulating read data
--------------------

The following commands were run to generate the simulated read data in
directories 'test1' and 'test2'.

    bash bin/sim.sh -o test1 -s 1378491420 seqs/mrna-isoform1.fa
    bash bin/sim.sh -o test2 -s 1378491420 seqs/mrnas.fa

Here is the terminal output.
